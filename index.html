              "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never writting a line of code. I needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by formal student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disapoint. They where very hand-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particilar, wasoutstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me learn the job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
